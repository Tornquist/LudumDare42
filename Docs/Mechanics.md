# Concept Development/Mechanics

[Back to README](../README.md)

**Selected Theme:** Space management company

**Premise:**

You are the cell phone provider of the future. Cell phones, with a personal touch. No more will users have to manage the data on their own devices. Instead, you'll back up everything for free... by hand.

You have to trigger when to backup data. Your company promises that the phone battery will last the whole day.

Unfortunantly you're a startup and can't just back everything up at night. The bandwidth requirements are too strict. So you have to balance uploading data by hand, and not all at the same time.

**Actions:**

* Increase user backup rate
* Decrease user backup rate
* Buy more bandwidth (extra backup unit)

**General Rules:**

* If the user's device gets full, you lose them as a customer
* More customers = more money
* No customers = game over
	* regardless of money in the bank
	* survival for x days is how you win
* You chose the rate customers pay
* High rate = slower growth, but some customers may leave
